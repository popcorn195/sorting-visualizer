Sorting Visualizer: An Interactive Tool for Algorithmic Understanding

1. Design: Create a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI). 
2. Visualization logic: Add logic to visualize the steps of each sorting algorithm. 
3. User interaction: Allow users to select the sorting algorithm and input data to be 
sorted.

The primary objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive sorting 
visualiser that enables users to visualise and compare the execution of different sorting 
algorithms. Thereby, enhancing their understanding and facilitating the development of 
more efficient algorithms.

The proposed solution involves creating a web-based application that helps visualise step 
by step execution of sorting algorithms. The application will allow users to input custom 
data, select desired algorithm and adjust parameters to observe algorithmâ€™s behaviour in 
real time.
